Constructed a neural network model by means of connecting RESNET-18 and LSTM in order to perform a regression task on 17 joints human pose video dataset(H36M) and output 3D body joint position, resulting in a 75mm MPJPE with 500 videos for training. 
Constructed a neural network model by connecting Conv3D/Conv2D, LSTM and MLP to perform a classification task on a 11-class human action video dataset(UCF-11), which achieved an 84.3\% accuracy.
