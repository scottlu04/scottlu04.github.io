Work under under the supervision of Prof. Ron Sun
Constructed a computational model for the effortful control process under the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/drronsun/clarion/clarion-project"> Clarion </a> framework, which
simulated each participant as an artificial agent with the explicit processing represented by multidimensional
condition-action pair and implicit processing represented by neural networks.
